	* src/lv_xmms.c:
	- lv_xmms_render_pcm() now uses a fast memcpy() instead
	of a for loop.
	- added fullscreen support.

	* src/lv_xmms.c: now print messages trough visual_log().

2004-06-22  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/lv_xmms.c:
	- use xmms_cfg_open_default_file() instead of 
	xmms_cfg_open_file().
	- on sdl_draw(), use SDL_Flip instead of SDL_UpdateRect(),
	because if we have hardware double buffer support, it
	is fast, otherwise, is equivalent to
	SDL_UpdateRect(screen, 0, 0, screen->width, screen->height);
	- on lv_xmms_cleanup(), SDL_MutexDestroy() is called 
	AFTER the render thread is not running anymore, otherwise
	we can crash the application if mutex is destroyed while
	the render thread is holding it.
	- change void lv_xmms_disable (void) to the correct type
	void lv_xmms_disable (VisPlugin *), otherwise XMMS
	crash when plugin is disabled from the config window.
	- now render thread is killed always, not only after 
	go sleep ten times.
	- lv_xmms_render_pcm() don't copy data is render thread
	is not running.
	- if SDL could not be initialized, show an error message.
	- after sucessfull SDL init, set atexit(SDL_Quit).
