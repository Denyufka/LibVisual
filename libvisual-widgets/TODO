This is a rough scrapbook like TODO list of what needs to be done.

Libvisual-widgets:
	GTK2:
		Implement library, get the VisUI widget working.
		Cleanup the widget a LOT!

	GTK1:
		Port GTK2 widget over to GTK1 for legacy. (order it like gtk2)
		Add notebook support.

	QT:
		Write neat QT widget to handle VisUI.
