If you'd like to hack on/using/for libvisual-widgets bare with the following:

Communication:
	I think it's very important to communicate with each other
	to give directions, avoid duplication of work and to share
	ideas. If you're planning to developer something for or
	using libvisual, please subscribe to the mailinglist that
	can be found www.sf.net/projects/libvisual/.

Codestyle:
	This software was indeed not written on a 80x25 terminal.
 	I dislike 80 chars per line. Thus I use a few times that.

	Use the code style that is present in libvisual-widgets,
	i'm not going to describe the complete codestyle
	in this document rather just look at the source
	and copy the style. I'm very strict when it
	comes to the codestyle within libvisual so obey it
	when you write something.

Patches:
	When you send me patches, send them in unified format, using
	diff -u.
