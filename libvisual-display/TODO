After libvisual 0.4.0 is released we're going to work on this list:
Version 0.4.0:
	Define requirements
	Design API
	Refactor everything to the API
	Cleanup code

	Have the following functional:
		x11 window
		x11 fullscreen (include xfvmode.h in source tree)
		GLX
		Event chaining
		FPS Control

Version 0.4.1:
	Ability to easily auto find a driver to a display setup.
	Ability to transfer a video to a different driver (think x11 window -> x11 fullscreen).
	Good multiple window API.
	Good multihead API.

	SDL driver
	VNC driver

Version 0.4.2:
	Easy on the fly depth changing.
	Rectangle update request.

Version 0.4.3:
	Multiple GLX context support (for same GLcore driver).
	PBuffer abstraction for plugins (projectm and friends)
		Also the time when we could look into including projectM with libvisual.

Version 0.4.4:
	Some kind of GLX abstraction.

	AAlib
	Libcaca
	Svgalib
	Framebuffer

Version 0.4.5:
	Make gstreamer and xine display plugins.

Version 0.6.0:
	Look into the possibility of supporting GL contexts for multiple cards in the same proces (dlopen!?)
